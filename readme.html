<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p>MultiLens is a CVS repository containing code necessary to produce
two JARs:
<ol>
<li>multilens.jar
<li>glutil.jar
</ol>

<p>The rest of this doc contains:

<h2>THE BIG PICTURE</h2>

<p>Here are the CVS repositories that contain code to run <a
href="http://www.movielens.umn.edu">www.movielens.umn.edu</a>, and how
they depend on each other.  An arrow indicates a dependency, with the
tail depending on the head.</p>

<pre>

       movielens3 ==> jrecserver ==> MultiLens (glutil.jar, glutil.pm)
          |                                        ^           ^
          |                                        |           |
          ======================================================
</pre>

<ol>

<li><strong>MultiLens</strong> contains code to build models, and use
models and ratings to produce recommendations for users.  It also
contains org.grouplens.util.* (which becomes glutil.jar) and
glutil.pm, which contain some utilities used by all Java and Perl for
reading configuration files, logging, etc.  These jars and pms could
live separately from MultiLens, but it was convenient to put them
there for now.

<li><strong>jrecserver</strong> contains code to serve up MultiLens
recommendations in Tomcat, and other low-level recommender operations,
e.g., build models.  This is nice because it may be run independently
of a web site, e.g. be used by 0 or many web sites.

<li><strong>movielens3</strong> contains code for a movie recommender
site that runs in Tomcat.  It has searching, submitting ratings,
getting recommendations, etc.  It communicates to jrecserver through
XML only.  This makes it fairly independent of jrecserver.  If someone
wished to create another recommendation server and offer an XML API,
it could use that instead.
</ol>

Each of the 3 applications represented by these CVS repositories uses
glutil.jar and glutil.pm.

<a name="checkingout"/>
<h1>CHECKING OUT MultiLens</h1>

Example for tcsh:

<pre>
  setenv CVSROOT /project/Grouplens/cvs-repository/
  cvs co MultiLens
</pre>

If you've got this doc, probably you've already done that.

<a name="prereqs"/>
<h1>EXTERNAL PREREQUISITES</h1>

MultiLens requires the following from external sources before it is
ready to run:

<table border>
<tr>
<td>Prerequisite</td>
<td>Example (on gibson, using tcsh)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Java 1.4</td>
<td>module load java/jdk-1.4</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ant</td>
<td>module load java/ant</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GL_CONFIG_FILE environment variable set to the full pathname of a
gl.properties file</td>
<td>setenv GL_CONFIG_FILE `pwd`/MultiLens/src/org/grouplens/util/test/gl.properties</td>
</tr>

</table>

<a name="config"/>
<h1>CONFIGURING</h1>

<p>All of the configuration changes necessary are in gl.properties.
You should copy an existing properties file and modify it.</p>

Properties to look at carefully and modify as necessary:

<ol>
<li>dbUrl
<li>dbUser
<li>dbPassword
<li>Anything starting with "multilens."
</ol>

<h1>COOKING MODELS</h1>

<a name="readonly"/>
<h2>
Read-only access
</h2>

<p>For read-only access to hugo, the production database, use the
'readonly' user (password is blank).  This user has no permissions to
update tables.  The application still works!</p>

<a name="#running"/>
<h1>RUNNING</h1>

<p>NOTE #1: <strong>Please don't run on our production machine (currently
hugo)!</strong>.  As long as you stay off that machine, it is very
unlikely you will accidentally shut down the production web site, even
if your configuration 'points' to the production site.</p>

<p>NOTE #2: If you wish to point to the production database, consider <a
href="#readonly">running read-only</a>, so you can play without
modifying the contents of the production database.</p>
