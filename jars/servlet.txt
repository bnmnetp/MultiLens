This jar is not necessary to run the 'jrec' servlet in Tomcat, because
it is bundled into Tomcat.  However, it is convenient to have this jar
here for now, in order to allow you to compile with and include in
development environments (like Eclipse).

servlet.jar came from

.../jakarta-tomcat-4.1.24/common/lib/servlet.jar .
